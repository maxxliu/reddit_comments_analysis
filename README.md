# reddit_comments_analysis

This project has 2 goals:

1. Be able to analyze the sentiment of keyword searches over time as well as keyword counts. We can do this for a variety of stocks and then see if we can train a machine learning model to predict quarterly earnings/ how earnings will do compared to estimates, based on the sentiment towards the stock or related terms.

2. It would be fun to figure out the top 10 meanest users on reddit, the time and day people post the most aggressive comments, and the top 10 users who have the most positive impact on other users.
