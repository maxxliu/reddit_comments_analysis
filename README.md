# reddit_comments_analysis

This project has 2 goals:

1. Be able to analyze the sentiment of keyword searches over time. For example, we could see how sentiment towards the word "trump" has changed over time.

2. Analyze every comment over time and catch words that had sudden spikes in both number of mentions and overall sentiment towards that word. A recent example, this application should be able to catch an increased mention of "United" with a large negative sentiment attached to the spike.
